# Logo Update

The logo has been successfully updated to use the local PNG file:

- HTML file now references: `content/logo.png`
- Logo file exists at: `/Users/hakonnordberg/Desktop/VÃ†R nettside/content/logo.png`
- CSS styles are already appropriate for the logo display

No further changes needed. The logo should now display correctly on the website.

## Final Verification
A final check confirms that the logo.png file exists in the correct location and the HTML is properly configured to display it.
